# NRZ-L-to-RZ-encoding-decoding-with-Matlab
NRZ(L) to RZ (encoding &amp; decoding) with Matlab

This project aims to convert the NRZ(L) to RZ (encoding) and also
to return it back from RZ to NRZ(L) (decoding) and this operations
can done by both MATLAB code (software) and by circuit done on
multisim which is a simulation that could by implemented in real
time hardware.
